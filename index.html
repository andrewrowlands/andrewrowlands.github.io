    I set out a goal, two years, when I came back, to bring a championship to this city. I gave everything that I had. I poured my heart, my blood, my sweat, my tears to this game and… against all odds, against all odds, I don’t know why we want to take the hardest road… I don’t know why the man above give me the hardest road but, its nothing the man above goin put you in situations that you can’t handle and I just kept that same positive attitude like… Instead of saying why me, saying this is what he want me to do and uh… CLEVELAND THIS IS FOR YOU!

    “I’m watching Iggy go up for the layup, and then I just see this black blur. It was like Superman swooping down in the movies. I’m dead serious. It was just a blur. I’ve seen crazy things on an NBA court. All kinds of freakish athleticism. But I’ve never seen anything like that. Lebron broke the laws of physics.” - Richard Jefferson

    That old cat from Akron… Born December 30th, 1984 to one Gloria James in Akron, Ohio. She held him up like this here and said behold doctors… This is going to be the greatest basketball player to ever live... She said I just can’t give you a regular name I can’t call you David, I can’t call you Craig, I can’t call you Michael or Larry I gotta give you something that everybody will remember… LeBron… The greatest basketball player to ever live…. Joy, how does he do that Skiuup?

    ‘If LeBron leaves Cleveland again, he doesn’t owe that city anything, I don’t want to hear it. You’re the luckiest franchise in the world that you had him. Before he arrived they were 17-65. Then he showed up in Cleveland and in 7 years they made the playoffs 5 times including 2 division titles and a final. And then he left and they butchered the number 1 pick, they were immediately awful and averaged 25 wins a year. Then he came back, 4 years, 3 finals, 1 title. This is a bottom 10 roster in the NBA without LeBron. He has given you everything. You were junk before him, you were junk when he left, and you’re going to be junk in an hour when he leaves. You know what I want to see when he leaves now… Statues. You know what I want to see… I want you to rename the city to Clebron, Ohio. I want the Browns to become the ‘Brons. I want a shrine. Because you before him and you after him have been utterly embarrassing.’ - Colin Cowherd

    ‘In 2015 we heard the Cavs are a year away, LeBron just got there, the Hawks are really good and then they sweep them and the narrative flips ‘ohh the East was wack’. In 2016 ‘the East was wack.’ Last year, ‘ohh the East was wack.’ All year long I’ve heard watch out for Toronto, Boston’s ready, Philly’s coming, Giannis might be on LeBron’s corner, and in 6 weeks, the narrative will be well of course they’re 9-0 going into Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, because ‘the East was wack.’ The reason ‘the East looks wack’ is because the Greatest Player Ever has been romping them for 15 years.’ - Nick Wright
